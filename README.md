# Codewars
Codewars is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as kata. These discrete programming exercises train a range of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online integrated development environment.

Here I upload solutions to small projects, primarily using Python, but also Ruby or Julia from time to time.
